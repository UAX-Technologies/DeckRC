***Repo Under Construction***

***Version History***

v1

-Simple script to install dependancies required to run QGC with full video

-Instrucitons to run QGC

-Instructions to setup joystick using Steam or using sc-controller


***Compatibility***

Currently compatible with any aircraft that uses the Mavlink protocol and can be connected to wirelessly. Some aircraft like the SkyviperV2450 can be connected to directly using built-in wifi for video and controls. Other aircraft may need a radio module or adapter to communicate wirelessly. 


***Radio Modules***

The Steam Deck can supply 7.5W from the USB port. With that power budget in mind, a prototype module using a Doodle Labs NanoOEM radio has been made and tested to over 1km (ran out of field). More details and radio module development is planned.
